Overview
The provided files form a basic web application with a simple navigation bar and a project listing page that uses PHP and MySQL to display data from a database. The application includes a homepage with a navigation bar, a PHP file to connect to the database and fetch project data, and a stylesheet for styling the application.

File Descriptions
HTML Files (index.html and about.html):

Both HTML files provide a structure for the navigation bar (navbar) and placeholders for content. The navigation bar contains links to different sections of the site, including "Home," "Projects," "About," and "Contact." The index.html file includes only the navigation bar, while about.html also includes a navigation bar but may differ in additional content.
Database Connection (db.php):

This PHP file handles the connection to a MySQL database using mysqli_connect. It connects to a database named "azzy" with the user "root" and an empty password. If the connection fails, it outputs an error message. This file is included in other PHP files to facilitate database interactions.
Project Listing (index.php):

This PHP file includes db.php to establish a connection to the database and runs a query to fetch project data. It retrieves project details (title, ID, category, description) from the "projects" table and displays them in an HTML table. The table is styled using CSS and provides a structured view of the projects.
CSS Styling (style.css):

The CSS file styles the entire application. It sets a background color for the body, styles the navigation bar with a teal background and white text, and ensures that links change color on hover. The table is styled for readability with padding, alternating row colors, and hover effects. Overall, the CSS provides a clean and professional look for the application.
Functionality Summary
Navigation Bar: The navigation bar is present on each HTML page, allowing users to navigate between different sections of the site, including home, projects, about, and contact pages.
Project Display: The index.php file dynamically retrieves and displays project data from the MySQL database. Each project is shown in a table format with columns for the project title, ID, category, and description.
Styling: The style.css file ensures consistent and visually appealing styling across the site, including the navigation bar and table formatting.
In essence, the application provides a straightforward interface for displaying project information, with a consistent navigation structure and a clean visual design.
